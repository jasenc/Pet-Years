#Pet Years

#### User Manual
	
This program determines the age of your pet. First input the rate at which your pet ages. For example, a dog has 7 years in one human year; this would mean that you have to type in the number 7. After that, the age of your pet in human years needs to be entered, followed by any remaining months in the next line. The age of your pet is then calculated using simplistic math functions. The age of your pet will be displayed according to the species time line.

#### System Manual 

This program was made using simple mathematical formulas such as addition, multiplication and division. Notice that in order for the years and months to be output correctly only the inputted months can have decimals. After buying this program from me, one way to improve this would be to use decimals in all inputs and have the years and months output correctly.

#### Test Log

I only ran into a few errors in making this program. Semicolons and get the number types correct.
